The Company

Resourceful Recruitment has been engaged by an Australian-owned energy storage technology company to recruit a Digital Design & Simulation Engineer based in Brisbane.

With strong capital backing and a clear growth roadmap, the company is entering a pivotal year of scaling and commercialisation.

This purpose-driven team of engineers, innovators and problem-solvers is united by a shared commitment to sustainability and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

If you're passionate about shaping the future of renewable energy and want to contribute to one of the most innovative technologies in storage, this is a unique opportunity to make a real impact.

Your Role
Reporting to the Manager of Product Development, you'll be the driving force behind the company’s Digital Twin capability and leading efforts to model, simulate, and synchronize digital assets with real-world performance as they develop their groundbreaking energy storage system.

You’ll shape the digital design roadmap, develop multiphysics simulation models, and support real-time integration for system prototyping, commissioning, and optimisation. This is a highly strategic and hands-on role with cross-functional influence across engineering, operations, and commercial teams.

Your key responsibilities will include:
Developing use cases and implementing the infrastructure for Digital Twin development
Creating, integrating and enhancing multiphysics simulation models
Enabling real-time and co-simulation capabilities to align digital systems with real-world performance
Working with large, complex datasets to generate performance insights and dashboards
Supporting the development and testing of prototypes and demonstration facilities
Providing input into IP development and product strategy
Your Background & Experience
We’re looking for a digitally-minded engineer who thrives in early-stage innovation environments. You’re naturally inquisitive, detail-oriented, and driven to find solutions to complex technical challenges.

You’ll bring:
Proven experience in Digital Twin development and simulation modelling
A strong foundation in Python and relevant tooling (min. 5 years)
Familiarity with control theory, optimisation, co-simulation, and machine learning techniques
An understanding of computing infrastructure, including virtualisation and messaging systems
A background in energy, mining, robotics, or industrial technology is desirable
Experience working in start-up or scale-up environments and cross-disciplinary teams
A degree in Engineering (Mechatronics or related) and/or Advanced Computing
Why Join?
Help shape a future-defining technology for clean energy
Take ownership of a critical area of innovation
Access long-term growth and leadership opportunities
Enjoy flexibility, purpose-driven work, and an equity incentive scheme
