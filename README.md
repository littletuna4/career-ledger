# Career Ledger

Welcome to the Career Ledger, a structured and extensible markdown-based record of my professional journey, projects, and achievements. This repository is designed to be both human-readable but mostly ai-indexable, supporting comprehensive documentation while remaining neatly organized.
This ideas has somewhat evolved into my pkm setup.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive, version-controlled log of:

- Roles and responsibilities at various employers
- Projects I've led or contributed to
- Technical and non-technical achievements
- Skills applied and developed over time
- Learnings, reflections, and milestones
  It aims to function as:
- A **living resume**
- A **career journal**
- A **portfolio backend**
- A **searchable, indexable archive** of professional work

## Repository Structure

The Career Ledger is organized into the following main sections:

```text
