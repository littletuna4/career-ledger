## Content Guidelines

### General Guidelines

- Each entry should be comprehensive and self-contained while referencing related content
- The tone should be very dry, technical, short in style, long in content. All implicit information and common knowledge should be avoided. Be robotically informative.
- Use markdown formatting consistently across all documents
- Include dates, durations, and specific contexts where applicable
- Make liberal use of internal cross-linking between related documents
- Link to external resources when appropriate (portfolios, GitHub repos, publications, etc.)
- Ensure all content is professional and appropriately detailed
- Files and folders should all be in snake-case

### Section-Specific Guidelines

#### Jobs Section

- **jobs.md** is the section index; link to it from README and other section indexes.
- **[employer].md** in each employer folder (e.g. bt-digital/bt-digital.md) should contain:
  - Employment duration
  - Official job titles and role evolutions
  - Department/team placement
  - High-level responsibilities
  - Key achievements summary
  - Links to detailed project entries

- **[project].md** files (under an employer or in employer/projects/) should include:
  - Project overview and business context
  - Your specific responsibilities and contributions
  - Technologies, methodologies, and frameworks used
  - Outcomes and impact (quantified when possible)
  - Challenges overcome
  - Key learnings

#### Projects Section

- **projects.md** is the section index; link to it from README and other section indexes.
- **[project].md** for each project folder (e.g. welltested/welltested.md) should provide:
  - Project scope and objectives
  - Your motivation for undertaking it
  - Timeline and development process
  - Results and reception
  - Links to demos, repositories, or live instances if available
- Use **build.md** and **reflections.md** in the same folder when the project has technical build notes or lessons learned.

#### Skills Section

- **skills.md** is the section index (not index.md).
- Group related skills together in meaningful categories
- Document skill progression over time in **timeline.md**, **reflections.md**, **recognitions.md**
- Connect skills to specific projects or roles where they were applied or developed
- Include both technical and soft skills

#### Education Section

- **education.md** is the section index (not index.md).
- **[institution].md** per institution (e.g. brisbane-boys-college.md) holds overview; add transcripts or other docs as needed (e.g. copy-of-transcript.md).
- Document formal degrees, certifications (in **certifications.md**), and significant training programs
- Include relevant coursework, major projects, and academic achievements
- Note particularly influential instructors or mentors

## Maintenance Guidelines

- When making file changes, always check for cross references and keep them up to date.
- Add new entries promptly after completing projects or changing roles
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout the repository
- Section entry points are jobs.md, projects.md, education.md, skills.md (not index.md).
- Use Obsidian wiki-links for internal cross-references: `[[PUBLIC/career-ledger/path/to/note|display text]]` from vault root so links resolve in the main vault.

## Integration Guidelines

- Cross-reference related content across different sections. (Use links)
- Create connections between skills and their practical applications.
- Link projects to relevant employer contexts when applicable
- Establish clear pathways between educational experiences and resulting career opportunities
